  <h1>Tribute to Saalumarada Thimmakka</h1>
  
<div class="section">
      <p> Saalumarada Thimmakka, lovingly known as the “Mother of Trees”, <br><br>
    was a humble yet powerful environmentalist from Karnataka whose lifelong dedication transformed a stretch of barren highway into a living green corridor. <br><br>
    Despite her lack of formal education and personal hardships, <br><br>
    she found purpose in nature and nurtured hundreds of banyan trees as though they were her own children <br><br>
    — showing the world that love, resilience, and commitment can grow forests. <br><br>
    Her legacy continues to inspire generations to care for the planet, one sapling at a time. </p>
  
    <h2>Born</h2>

    <h2>Personal Story</h2>

    <h2>How She Did It</h2>
    <p>The couple fetched water over long distances, carried saplings, dug pits by hand, protected them from cattle, and cared for them daily.</p>
    <h2>Recognition</h2>
    <p>Awarded the Padma Shri in 2019.</p>
    <p>Also received other honors like the Nadoja Award, National Citizen Award, and Vrikshamitra Award.</p>
