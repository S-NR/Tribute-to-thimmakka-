<h1>🌱 Tribute to Saalumarada Thimmakka 🌱</h1>
<h3>#JaiThimmakka</h3>

<div class="section">
  <p><span class="highlight">Saalumarada Thimmakka</span>, lovingly known as the “Mother of Trees”, was a humble yet powerful environmentalist from Karnataka whose lifelong dedication transformed a stretch of barren highway into a living green corridor.</p>
  <p>Despite her lack of formal education and personal hardships, she nurtured hundreds of banyan trees as though they were her own children — showing the world that love, resilience, and commitment can grow forests.</p>
  <p>Her legacy continues to inspire generations to care for the planet, one sapling at a time.</p>

  <h2>🌱 Tribute Details</h2>
  <p><strong>Born:</strong> 30 June 1911 in Gubbi taluk, Tumakuru district, Karnataka.</p>
  <p><strong>Died:</strong> 14 November 2025 in Bengaluru, Karnataka, aged 114.</p>
  <p><strong>Why She Is Famous:</strong> She planted and nurtured 385 banyan trees along a 4.5 km stretch between Hulikal and Kudur.</p>
  <p><strong>Other Work:</strong> Over her life, she also planted nearly 8,000 other trees.</p>
  <p><strong>Personal Story:</strong> She had no formal schooling, married at a young age, and she and her husband, Chikkaiah, were unable to have children.</p>
  <p><strong>How She Did It:</strong> The couple fetched water over long distances, carried saplings, dug pits by hand, protected them from cattle, and cared for them daily.</p>
  <p><strong>Recognition:</strong> Awarded the Padma Shri in 2019. Also received honors like the Nadoja Award, National Citizen Award, and Vrikshamitra Award.</p>
  <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Her work became a powerful symbol of grassroots environmentalism. Even in old age, she inspired millions — urging people to treat trees like their own children.</p>
